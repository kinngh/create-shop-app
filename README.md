`npx create-shop-app@latest`

A CLI tool to generate embedded Shopify app boilerplate with a stack of your choice. The current published package is an experimental build that is not recommended for use in production and substantial efforts are being taken to build a stable CLI tool.

## Notes

- [Setup](./SETUP.md) for setting up the CLI. To generate code, use `npx create-shop-app@latest` instead.
- There is always something that can be made better. Please open an Issue, Discussion or reach out to me on [@kinngh](https://twitter.com/kinngh) on Twitter.
- The CLI uses my [kinngh/shopify-node-express-mongodb-app](http://github.com/kinngh/shopify-node-express-mongodb-app) repo as a base and swaps out tech based on choices and is opinionated.
- I recommend using [kinngh/shopify-node-express-mongodb-app](http://github.com/kinngh/shopify-node-express-mongodb-app) to open issues related to the base template since that's what is being used.
